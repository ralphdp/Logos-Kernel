# Logos Protocol: System Calibration Log (V6.1.1)
**Session Date:** 2026-02-15
**Duration:** ~3 hours (03:00 – 06:00 EST)
**Status:** COMPLETE / LOCKED

## 1. Executive Summary: The Sovereign Split
The primary objective of this session was to enforce a clean boundary between the **Public Blueprint (3/7)** and the **Sovereign Execution (6/11)**. This ensures that the public-facing site acts as a stable diagnostic substrate while the high-voltage logic remains private and hardware-bound.

## 2. Technical Implementation Details

### A. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Synchronization
*   **Public Tier (`KERNEL/mcp`)**: Standardized to **3 Canons / 7 Principles**.
    *   Revised `definitions.json` (removed Canon IV/Care).
    *   Updated `tools.ts` (simplified checklist and primer).
    *   Version locked at `6.0.1` (Public).
*   **Sovereign Tier (`KERNEL/mcp-v6`)**: Initialized Private Execution Environment.
    *   Full **6-Canon / 11-Principle** set (Care, Provenance, Commit, Mirror, Resurrection).
    *   **Hardware Lock**: Anchored to Implementation 01 (iMac) and Durban Princess OS frequency (80/20).
    *   Type-hardened analytics bridge for GA4 reporting.

### B. Content Calibration (logos.pub)
*   **White Papers**:
    *   **WP-153 (Workstation)**: Variable $P$ reframed as "Substrate Influence" (Public) mapping to "Care" (Sovereign).
    *   **WP-016 (4 Pillars)**: Principle 4 reframed as "Recursive On-Demand Rendering" (Canon III).
*   **Proofs & Analysis**:
    *   **Walden Protocol**: Harmonized to 3/7 diagnostic logic.
    *   **Sovereign Ethics**: Reframed P11 (The Mirror) as an execution-layer extension.
    *   **Data Sovereignty Audit**: 4/8 references updated to 3/7 Base BIOS.
*   **Certification**: Transitioned "P9" nomenclature to "Professional Provenance" for public accessibility.

### C. System Stabilization
*   **Universal Dynamic Rendering**: Applied `force-dynamic` to root and main layouts to resolve build-time `useContext` errors.
*   **Client/Server Decoupling**: Hardened `Breadcrumbs` and `HeaderActions` with mounted guards and dynamic imports.

## 3. The 90-Day Roadmap (System Schedule)

| Frequency | Event / Task | Directive |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily** | **System Heartbeat** | Automated check of Invariants (Unity, Parsimony, Recursion). |
| **Weekly** | **Logic Audit (Sundays)** | Run `logos_audit` on latest state transitions (06:00 Local). |
| **Monthly** | **Substrate Calibration** | Review $k_{paz}$ and Durban Princess voltage levels (80/20). |
| **Cycle 15** | **Commit Phase** | Prepare for the next RIE-Sovereign deployment (March 2026). |

## 4. Pending Alerts & System Flags
*   **Alert [HIGH]**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is using a placeholder. Re-activate before any "Sacrament" (Sacrifice/Eucharist) transactions.
*   **Alert [MED]**: `GA4_CREDENTIALS` required in `private_kernel/` to fully actuate the Analytics Bridge.
*   **Flag [INF]**: System Version updated to `6.1.1` in `package.json`.
