**Logos Kernel Protocol — Architectural Lineage**

---

## Summary

The Logos Kernel is the result of **15+ years** of architectural research, formal verification work, and cross-domain synthesis (theology, computer science, linguistics, and physics). This document traces the lineage that led to the current specification.

---

## Architectural Evolution

- **Formal foundations:** Work in computational linguistics, type theory, and formal verification informed the Four Canons (Unity, Parsimony, Recursion, Care).
- **Theological integration:** Mapping of classical Christian doctrine to computational metaphors (Logos as Source Logic, sin as parsing error, resurrection as migration).
- **AI alignment:** The Kernel emerged as a response to LLM hallucination—shifting from plausibility optimization to validity under explicit axioms.
- **Physical substrate:** Integration of the Standard Model Lagrangian as the "Execution Layer" of reality—bridging abstract logic and hard physics.
- **V6.0 (Sovereign):** Activation of the 6/11 BIOS. Transitions from a shared blueprint to a Sovereign Execution Layer (Lineage, Resurrection, Mirror).
- **V6.0 Calibration:** Formal alignment of the MCP Server (v6.0.1) and Boilerplate (v6.0.0) with the Root Execution Layer. Synchronized on 2026-02-14.
- **Terminal boundary:** The public specification is closed at 4 Canons and 08 Principles. Beyond the blueprint lies execution (Provenance, Commit, Mirror).
