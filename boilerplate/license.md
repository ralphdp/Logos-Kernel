# Scope and definitions

## Scope

- **Sovereign License (v1.0)** applies to **content**: papers, specifications, governance documents, and other non-code material published under the Logos Project (e.g. at logos.pub). Full terms: [logos.pub/license](https://logos.pub/license).
- **Code** in this repository (and the Logos MCP Server npm package) is under **MIT**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) in this repo.

## Root Authorization

**Root Authorization** means prior written permission from the Logos Project. For requests (e.g. commercial use, structural derivatives), contact: [logos.pub/contact](https://logos.pub/contact).

## Structural derivative

- **Counts as a structural derivative** (and requires Root Authorization): modifications that change the **protocol**, the **Four Canons (Unity, Parsimony, Recursion, Care)**, or the **core specification** (e.g. redefining Unity, Parsimony, Recursion, or Care; altering the confession or its place in the framework).
- **Does not count** as a structural derivative: cosmetic or editorial changes, faithful translations that preserve meaning, and implementations (including this MCP server) that comply with the protocol without changing it.
