## 🛠 IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAY

1.  **Frontend**: Update `/beyond` to include a Stripe integration for the "Sovereign Warden" tier.
2.  **API Gating**: Use the `verified` cookie (handshake) to unlock Tier 1, and a `subscriber` metadata check for Tier 2/3 at `api.logos.pub`.
3.  **Auditor Form**: The existing Auditor Handshake Form should be the entry point for Tier 3.

**SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT**: STABLE (DE PAZ)
**URGENCY**: PHASE 3 ACTUATION (Next 72 Hours)
